This was my entry in [Phoenix Phrenzy](https://phoenixphrenzy.com), showing off what [Phoenix](https://phoenixframework.org/) and [LiveView](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view) can do.

Unfortunately I didn't submit it in time, but here it is anyway.

## The Usual README Content

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
